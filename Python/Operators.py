#Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
#Operators in Python
#Arithmetic operators
#Assignment operators
#Comparison operators
#Logical operators

x = 4
y = 5
#Arithmetic Operators
#Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations:
#Addition
print(x + y)
#Subtraction
print(x - y)
#Multiplication
print(x * y)
#Division
print(x / y)
#Modules
print(x % y)

#######################
x = 4
y = 5
#Assignment Operators
#Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables
#x = 5
print(x = 5)
#x = x + 3
print(x += 3)
#x = x - 3
print(x -= 3)
#x = x * 3
print(x *= 3)
#x = x / 3
print(x /= 3)
#x = x % 3
print(x %= 3)

#######################
x = 4
y = 5
#Comparision Operators
#Comparision operators are used to compare two values
#Equal
print(x == y)
#Not Equal
print(x != y)
#Greater than
print(x > y)
#Less than
print(x < y)
#Greater than or Equal
print(x >= y)
#less than or Equal
print(x <= y)

#######################
x = 4
y = 5
#Logical Operators
#Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements
#And
#Returns true if both statements are true
print(x < 5 and x < 10)
#Or
#Returns True if one on the statements is true
print(x < 5 or x < 4)
#Not
#Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true
print(not(x < 5 and x < 10))
